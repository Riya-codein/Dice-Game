# Dice-Game
I have created a dice game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript as my practice project.

Whenever we refresh the page, a random number gets generated and equivalent to the number the dice would be thrown. Depending upon the player which has the greatest number on the dice, the game would declare the winner. If both the player gets the same number generated, it would show Draw.
